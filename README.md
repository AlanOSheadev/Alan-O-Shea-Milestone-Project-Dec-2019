### UX
User Expectations
A customer visiting my site will want to get as much information as possible in a short space of time.  The person visiting the site wants to know what is on offer.  They are expecting to see photos and videos of the product, they will also expect a site that loads quickly with fast acting links.  In order to make a purchase customers visiting the site want to know that it’s safe to purchase from it. I have used the link from Github and asked people to give some feeback on the site.  Overall they found the site interesting and enjoyable and they suggested that I change the buttons to links as did my mentor who also suggested removing the bullet points.
### Strategy
My aim was to design a site that immediately captures the visitors attention and encourage them to scroll through the site.  I have placed pictures and videos which explain Rodfendr and I have placed a discount offer for potential customers to take advantage of.  If a picture is worth a thousand words how many is a video worth.  I didn’t want to overload the visitor with long descriptions.
### Scope
The site is designed to promote Rodfendr the lightest fishing rod rest in the world. I want the visitor to understand Rodfendr and for them to think that it is a unique and interesting product that they would buy for themselves or for a friend or loved one. I am also offering them a discount if they decide to purchase through their visit.
### Structure
I immediately want the visitor to see the benefits of using Rodfendr, they can see me relaxing and using Rodfendr to protect my fishing rod.  The video after the heading is about 30 seconds long and quickly explains Rodfendr, there are some photos with small text explaining more about Rodfendr in the About section, followed by some of the features and an introduction to an article written by Off The Scale fishing magazine. These features have accompanying photos and videos.

### Surface
The colors were chosen to contrast easily and make it easy to locate the links especially the “Buy now” link which has an extra orange icon.  The background colors and font colors were chosen to make it easy on the visitors eyes and I used photos and videos instead of a lot of sentences so as not to overload the visitor
### Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

### Features
 A call to action button was added to the first image to encourage visitors to follow through with a purchase of Rodfendr.  The "Buy Now" button was also added to the header and footer and the credit card icon was colored orange to attract the visitors eye so that they would be encouraged to press the button which takes them to our ecommerce check out.  The checkout is fully functioning and will safeyly process your order and you will receive your order asap.  The images and videos are designed to inform and entertain and to keep the page interesting.  The links to my main website www.Rodfendr.com are used to give the user a full ecommerce experience.  All the social media links arrive at Rodfendr owned pages. 

### Features Left to Implement
I would like to add an email address to the contact us form so that I can receive any questions or feedback from potential customers and a cookie bar to make it a legal site.  I would also like to add some of my other products to give customers a wider choice.
### Testing
Extensive testing of the navbar buttons was made to ensure that each button would result in the correct response once clicked.  The "Home", button will return the visitor to home from any other page and it will return you to the top of the landing page if clicked either in the header or footer.  The "About us" button will bring the user to a seprate page which has the about us information, this was done because on smaller screens some of the pictures are edited out but the user can click on the hamburger menu and still access all the about us information with this button. The Buy now button is placed in the header the first image on the landing page and the footer.  In the header and footer the credit card icon is orange in color so as to attract the user to the button.  The buy now buttons will direct the user to a check out page for Rodfendr and this is the expected result.  Immediately after the main image the discount button 'Fendr' will also bring the user to the checkout as expected in a separate window. The "Rodfendr" button will bring the user to the full main site www.Rodfenr.com as it is designed to allow the visitor the option to view other products. In the footer the Home, and About us buttons act in the same way as in the header ie bringing the user to the correct page.  The privacy button is targeted at our privacy page where your legal rights to privacy are explained and functions as expected.  All the social media links were tested and bring the visitor to the various social media pages, in a separate targeted window, as was hoped for. All the buttons are targeted using 'target = "_blank".  There are several "here." links colored purple on the  landing page and about us page each of them provides a link to a pdf in a seperate targeted window as with the buttons. The pdfs give extra information and can be downloaded if needed and this is what was expected. The contact us page is a bootstrap form and each field is marked as required, if the correct information is not put into the correct field an error message appears if the correct format is used to enter information then the page will refresh and clear the fields as is expected. This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5/SE,6,7,8 iPhone 6,7,8 plus, iPhone X : Chrome and Safari, iPad, iPad Pro,Samsung Galaxy Slll,5S) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
All links will open in a new tab using - 'target="_blank"'. All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination. The article by Off the Scale, and the customer opinions are pdf’s and can be downloaded if the visitor wishes to view them later. I used W3C validator to check and adjust any HTML errors which occurred I was left with one iframe error which I have not found a solution for yet : Error: The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.

From line 55, column 25; to line 55, column 210

          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XduJ2Gkgbj0?autoplay=0&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></ifram
I used W3C CSS validator and I only had 2 errors which as of yet I am unable to fix : 
Parse Error .col-md-4 { -ms-flex: 0 0 33.333333%; flex: 0 0 33.333333%; max-width: 100%; }
Parse Error .col-md-6 { flex: 0 0 50%; max-width: 100%; margin: 5px; }

There were a number of warnings, these are Bootstrap related issues and I'm not sure if a fix is required for them.

### Deployment
I used Github to host this website.  The site is automatically updated and all changes are logged once a commit has been made to the master branch.  Periodically throughout the development of the site changes and updates have been added using the git commit -m “” command. The landing page is called index.html, which is a required attribute to allow the site to deploy correctly.
## Credits
1. This site uses Bootstrap, fontawesome, hover, javascript for the hamburger menu. 
2. I used code I found on Blacboard to stop my youtube video from continuing to play after it ends 0&rel=0. 
3. I used code from Computer Hope to rotate images "rotateimage".
4. All my code has been taken from the previous projects I have taken part in as well as Bootstrap.
5. I have modified the code I used and added my own styling to suit the website. 
6. I have left uncomments throughout the code where I have used code not my own. 
7. I have used google fonts for the main fonts and font awesome for the icons.

### Content
All content on the site has been created by me or I have permission to use it.  
### Media
All photos and videos are provided by me from the assets folder except for the large video which I added from my Youtube channel, this video is larger and I didn’t want to slow down the upload speed of the page by loading it from my images folder. I have permission to use the Facebook posts from Emmett, Nick, Rosaleene and the article written by Off the Scale Magazine.
Acknowledgements
The navbars are bootstrap and the button code and image code were adapted from the Whiskey drop and Rosie projects. I used Youtube to import the main video to the landing page.
